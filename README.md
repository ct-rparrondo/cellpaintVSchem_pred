# Harnessing Cell Painting and Machine Learning to Predict Drug Safety and Pharmacology  
### Raquel Parrondo, Albert A. Antolin, and Jordi Mestres

Here it is available the code (/src) and different notebooks (/notebooks/ ) to reproduce our work and analyse the results obtained in the study: **Harnessing Cell Painting and Machine Learning to Predict Drug Saftey and Phramacology**. 

- **[data](data/)** contains all predictive model results to evaluate the outcomes and visualize the results.
- **[src](src/)** contains the source code cotaining all functions called by the Notebooks.
- **[notebooks](notebooks/)** contains the necessary Notebooks to reproduce our work and inspect the results.

*Important*: Data folder contains model results to analyse the results. Initial data to train the models will be made accessible upon request.
